    <div class="H1animate"><h1>SURPRISE DISCOVERY & SENSORIALITY</h1></div>

SURPRISE DISCOVERY & SENSORIALITY
Products staged to be touched & discovered. Uniquenss conveyed by creating a space for chance discovery and unrepeatablitiliy. Shop attendants are inviting stewards of the brand

TIME TRAVEL & ARCHIVE
Pick & Mix archive. Vintage decadence* . 
Bright lighting, textured cream walls, brass fixtures and mid 20th century furnishings. (*Decadere - Latin etymology “to fall”. Roman & Victorian ruins, unruly gardens)


THEATER & TRANSFORMATION
Dionysian themes, theater, cross dressing, occult magic and shamanism. Put - on & parody. Fetish.
The stark, sometimes grotesque lighting is disorienting as it cues downmarket department store or 1980s mall, radically upending expectations of luxury. 
 

 
DISCOVERY &
CO-CREATION
 
 “We have all kinds of customers,” “Everybody is free to do what they want.” 
‘Today, we live in a world of 
contrasts and it is this that makes life interesting,’ 
- Alessandro Michele

One of the major contributions of Alessandro Michele’s so-called ‘Gucci Revolution’ is the movement of the brand firmly into the 21st century by defining a new 
vocabulary of luxury as Co-creation, Inclusiveness & Ephemerality.
While Personalization and Made to Order are Masstige and Fast Fashion gimmicks that threaten to massify Gucci, the daring play of upmarket and downmarket cues (as well as high and low cultural and aesthetic references) within the collections themselves can be seen consistently across retail and online communications. So far this is a winning combination, refreshing the brand and positively impacting the bottom line.
